-So, writing a ticket's reference in [] on a commit links the jira issue to the branch!-
Scrap that, by listing a ticket to a commit message you link the COMMIT to the jira ticket!!

Doesn't mean you should though...


What is funny is that a previously linked ticket is not updated unless you specify them on the commit!
